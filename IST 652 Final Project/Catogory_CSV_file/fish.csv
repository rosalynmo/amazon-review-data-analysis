"These pellets don't sink as advertised.","It says ""Sinking pellets,"" and that they are good for bottom feeders, yet these pellets don't sink at all, they never get to the bottom they just continue to float around the top of the tank regardless of how much time passes. Complete waste of money and entirely that is completely worthless for the advertised task. I would not buy again, and I do not recommend these to anyone. Complete rip-off of a product. Don't get cheated by a bad product, buy something else.","07 Jul 2021","Size: 6.5 Ounce","","Yes","Doug W.","1.0","Aqueon 06188 Shrimp Pellets Fish Food, 3-1/4-Ounce","https://www.amazon.com/Aqueon-06188-Shrimp-Pellets-4-Ounce/product-reviews/B004GWQ2TQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=10"
